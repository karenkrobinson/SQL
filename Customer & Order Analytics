##In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers as c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
ON c.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
sum(quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
count(distinct c.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as c
ON Feb.orderid=c.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 
SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%New York%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as c
ON Feb.orderId=c.order_ID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT sum(quantity)/count(c.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as c
ON Feb.orderID=c.order_ID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, sum(quantity*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1
